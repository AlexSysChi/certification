Exceptions:
    1.  Each try block must be followed by catch or finally block (or both)
    2.  When code try to convert string to a number (in case proper implementation)
        and string in inappropriate format than NumberFormatException will be thrown
Class construction:
    1.  The Only mandatory class component is a constructor.
        Even it wasn't implemented manually - compile will generate default one
    2.  Class names mustn't contain Java keywords
    3.  Top level class mustn't have [static, private, protected] modifiers

StringBuilder:
    1. StringBuilder object sb could be placed in sout (sb.toString() will be called)
    2. Default capacity is 16. If sb initialized with some string, capacity will be equal
        to 16 + length of string attribute

Arrays:
    1. length field for multidimensional array store size of 'first lay' array

ArrayList:
    1.  default size of ArrayList is 10, but due to 'lazy actions' size of arrayList will
        be zero, until first element is put, after that size of arrayList will be equal 10
        (until resizing if size wouldn't be enough)

Arithmetic operations:
    1. remainder of the division will have the same sign as divided

Wrappers:
    1.  Wrappers can't wide from one to another. [ex. Float object couldn't be converted to Double implicitly]

    2. Another situation with converting float to Double, here two step are required:
        float->double->Double, but when Java wides/wraps types - it is only one step will be implemented
        (in our example from float to double, but we need to wrap double to Double - it won't be implemented)
